# AutomationWorks
Journey of Automation

For this journey we will use <code> #!/usr/bin/env python3 </code>

We start with "Modules" as these are important components of code reuse concept. The modules are basically collection of .py files. The python files inside of a modules contain different functions. These functions can be called using the module name and . or dot notation followed by the function name.

One thing to remember, to use the module to be recognised by an interpreter we need to include <code>" __init__.py "</code> file.
